Inside this php script you are requested to do two things:

1. Read all the numbers from the file named data.txt -> sum them and print them out 

in html.



2. Add one input + button in a form to this page. When the button is pressed,

and the page reloaded, read the number from the input, search it inside the

data.txt file and print out how many times did you find it (COUNT the occurrences of

the given number).
