Session exercise to be solved:

Create one php script that will add numbers to a sum
that you store in a session variable.
 
You need to create a form with one input and a button -> add
 
You need to continuously ADD the number that the user 
has entered to a value that is PERSISTENT (in the server's memory).
 
You also need to display the value of the sum that the server has added so far.
 
If, the user has JUST landed on the webpage, initialize your sum with 0.
