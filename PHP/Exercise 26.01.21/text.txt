You are given two arrays:

$items = ["Fruits","Vegetables","Meat","Carrots","Peas","Beans","Tomatoes"]
$indices =[1,-1,0,3,4,5,6,2,7,0];

TASK 1: Check if the INDICES in the second array ARE VALID indices to use in the FIRST array. If 
you have any item OUT of range, you should fix the $items array by removing the item that is not
in the correct range.

TASK 2: Assuming the correct indices array,
display an unordered list with items from the $items array using 
the given $indices array.
